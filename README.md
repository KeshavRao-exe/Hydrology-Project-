### Problem Statement 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 92% of the world’s population breathes air that exceeds its own guideline limits. Industry, transport systems, power generation and waste incineration cause particularly high levels of air pollutants, forming a threat to health and climate. Pollutants increase the risk of getting respiratory and certain heart diseases, lung cancer, pneumonia and strokes. Furthermore, they worsen the physical condition of patients with e.g. asthma, bronchitis. Mostly, children, elders and outdoor workers are impacted by health-damaging factors like PM 2.5.   
Regarding the climate, pollutants are linked to the earth’s climate and ecosystems globally as major drivers of air pollutants like combustion of fossil fuel cause greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, Sulphur (SO2) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions directly affect the ecosystem’s ability to function and grow.     

### Objective
In our project we aim to evaluate and plot the concentration of selected pollutants in several Indian cities. After this, we plan to implement machine learning algorithms to predict the AQI of the health-damaging pollutants PM10 and PM2.5. With the algorithms we will create a predictor, showing the expected daily AQI.
